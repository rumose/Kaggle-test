The food has its own characteristics of each country.
In this project,we can distinguish different countries by
different ingredients.\\
This is an interesting project.

\section{Data} \label{sec-preliminaries}

This event provides two data sets that can be used: train.json  test.json\\
\textbf{train.json}:In the dataset, we include the recipe id, the type of cuisine, and the list of ingredients of each recipe (of variable length). The data is stored in JSON format. \\
\textbf{test.json}:In the test file test.json, the format of a recipe is the same as train.json, only the cuisine type is removed, as it is the target variable you are going to predict.

\section{Data Processing} \label{sec-method}
\begin{itemize}
  \item
  Read Data \\
  \begin{itemize}
  \item
  Read train.json
  \item
  Read test.json
  \end{itemize}
  \item
  Processing Model:Bag-of-words model (BoW model)\\
  \begin{itemize}
    \item 
    BoW early in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval 
    This model ignored the grammar and word order elements such as text, 
    just as it is a collection of several words, the emergence of each
     word in the document are independent of each otherBoW to use an 
     unordered list of words to express a text or a document.
  \end{itemize}
   \begin{itemize}
    \item
    CountVectorizer is a characteristic class of common numerical calculation,
    Is a text feature extraction method.For each training text, it only considers 
    each of these words in the frequency of the training in the text.
    CountVectorizer Converts text of the words in the word frequency matrix.
    It does this by fit_transform function calculating the number of occurrences of all words.
    \end{itemize}

  \item 
  RandomForestClassifier\\

\begin{itemize}
\item
The first step is using feature and target training classifier.
\item
The second step is to input data to classifier which has trained before.
\item 
Export data and Store them in a document.

\section{Conclusions} \label{sec-conclusions}
Every country has its specialties,each cuisine has it's own ingredients.During this competition,I learned how to
identify the country by different ingredients.At the same time, I also learned how to deal with plain text data set-
BoW model,besides,CountVectorizer is also a great way to extracting text feature.In the end,using feature we extarcted to
classify in RandomForestClassifier.\\
Of course,this project has no proper data visualization processing,and I didn't use a variety of methods to compare,
they are all basic and single methods.
